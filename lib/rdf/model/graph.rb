  # An RDF graph.
  #
  # An {RDF::Graph} contains a unique set of {RDF::Statement}. It is
  # based on an underlying data object, which may be specified when the
  # graph is initialized, and will default to a {RDF::Repository} without
  # support for named graphs otherwise.
  #
  # Note that in RDF 1.1, graphs are not named, but are associated with
  # a graph name in a Dataset, as a pair of <name, graph>.
  # This class allows a name to be associated with a graph when it is
  # a projection of an underlying {RDF::Repository} supporting graph_names.
  #
  # @example Creating an empty unnamed graph
  #   graph = RDF::Graph.new
  #
  # @example Loading graph data from a URL
  #   graph = RDF::Graph.load("http://ruby-rdf.github.io/rdf/etc/doap.nt")
  #
  # @example Loading graph data from a URL
  #   require 'rdf/rdfxml'  # for RDF/XML support
  #
  #   graph = RDF::Graph.load("http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0081dq5.rdf")
  #
  # @example Accessing a specific named graph within a {RDF::Repository}
  #   require 'rdf/trig'  # for TriG support
  #
  #   repository = graph = RDF::Repository.load("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruby-rdf/rdf-trig/develop/etc/doap.trig", format: :trig))
  #   graph = RDF::Graph.new(graph_name: RDF::URI("http://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me"), data: repository)
